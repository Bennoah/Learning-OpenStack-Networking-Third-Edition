**Build a solid foundation in virtual networking technologies for OpenStack-based clouds**

## What is this book about?
OpenStack Networking is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven system to manage physical and virtual networking resources in an OpenStack-based cloud. Like other core OpenStack components, OpenStack Networking can be used by administrators and users to increase the value and maximize the use of existing datacenter resources. This third edition of Learning OpenStack Networking walks you through the installation of OpenStack and provides you with a foundation that can be used to build a scalable and production-ready OpenStack cloud.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Get familiar with Neutron constructs, including agents and plugins 
Build foundational Neutron resources to provide connectivity to instances 
Work with legacy Neutron routers and troubleshoot traffic through them 
Explore high-availability routing capabilities utilizing Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) 
Create and manage load balancers and associated components 
Manage security groups as a method of securing traffic to and from instances

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
[DEFAULT]
...
my_ip = 10.254.254.101
vncserver_proxyclient_address = 10.254.254.101
vnc_enabled = True
vncserver_listen = 0.0.0.0
novncproxy_base_url = http://controller01:6080/vnc_auto.html
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are an OpenStack-based cloud operator and administrator who is new to Neutron networking and wants to build your very own OpenStack cloud, then this book is for you.Prior networking experience and a physical server and network infrastructure is recommended to follow along with concepts demonstrated in the book.
